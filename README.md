This program allows users to play a game of breakout with rows of colored blocks. The user controls a paddle from left to right that follows their mouse movements while a ball bounces off the walls and paddle, destroying the blocks that it hits. A score is kept and the player is given three lives. If the ball leaves the bottom of the screen then the player will lose a life and once all lives are lost their is a "Game Over" text displayed.
